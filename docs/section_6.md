### Prebuilt Agents - 4.1.2020:

Prebuilt Agents are Agents which have been develeoped by Teams of Dialogflow with specific knowledge. One thing to keep in my although is that the prebuilt agents are not finished. 

You can add prebuilt agents directly via the menu under Prebuilt Agents. For example if we look at a navigation agent we can see that the intents have training phrases and parameters, but no response. 

So prebuilt agents don't specify what the bot is going to say, but they understand what the user wants, which is pretty important. You can also use one and modify it in a way, which fits for you.
